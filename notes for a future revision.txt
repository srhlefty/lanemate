Board changes for next revision:
- Fix DONE wiring
- Change micro's power supply to 3.3V
- SD rx chip also supports S-video and component; add connectors for those
- For the SD input, a differential amp is not needed. Instead use the simple termination input described in the data sheet.
- 5V regulator is connected incorrectly; input voltage should be plug power, not 3.3V
- Connect output VSYNC to the micro
- Consider making the video connectors headers which then use ribbon cable to connect to bulkhead connectors on the enclosure
  - e.g. L-com Item # VHC00023
- Alternatively, use HDMI connectors that have a panel mount feature
  - e.g. A108402-ND
  - also 889-2944-ND, but inside is another HDMI female so requires an actual HDMI cable inside the box
