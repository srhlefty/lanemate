- Fix DONE wiring
- Move interrupt pin on HDMI RX to the micro
- Move reset pin on HDMI RX to the micro
- That reset pin needs a soft pullup instead of a hard pullup
- Change micro's power supply to 3.3V
- SD rx chip also supports S-video and component; add connectors for those
- For the SD input, a differential amp is not needed. Instead use the simple termination input described in the data sheet.
